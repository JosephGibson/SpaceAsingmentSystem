Feature driven development plan:
The Space Assignment System 

Iteration 1.0 

Key features that still need to be developed: 

    • Submit a request for a given time period. (User)
    • Approve / deny a valid request.   (Admin)
        ◦ Check that a request is Valid (System)
        ◦ Notify uses on cancellation, rejection or approval.
    • Cancel a room request that is valid (User)
        ◦ Remove the request from the pending approval requests. 
    • Black out a given room for a given time frame.  (Admin)
        ◦ Black out a room on a set schedule (Admin)
        ◦ Black out a room for a single time slot. (Admin)
    • Modify the Calendar (Admin) 
        ◦ Add new rooms
        ◦ Change valid booking times. 
      


The main goal of this iteration will be producing a system in which we can submit a request, and then have it approved by a system admin. This will help us produce an executable architecture in which we can continue to iterate and build up some of our other features. Developing this feature will allow us to further develop the request handler in the next iteration. The main goal of each iteration will be producing a architecture that allows us to add onto it building upon our feature list. There are still many features left to implement, but we first will implement the features of the highest priority. This each iteration will also allow us to refine our user interface if any oversights become apparent in the future. This iterative design approach will help us track any key changes and design decisions.
